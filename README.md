|   **Homework Files**   | **Description** |
|----------------|------------|
|[README.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-figalit/blob/master/README.md)|This readme.md file provides an overview of the ghist of this repo and provides useful pointers to key files in my homework-7 repo |
|[foofactors](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-figalit/blob/master/foofactors)| This contains the `foofactors` R project.  |

I chose a couple tasks I found interesting to add to the `foofactors` package. They're described below:

| **Description**  | **Link** | **Status** |
|------------------|----------|------------|
| write a version of `reorder()` that uses `desc()` a la `(d)plyr` | [reorder_desc.R](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-figalit/blob/master/foofactors/R/reorder_desc.R) | üëç |
| write a version of `factor()` that sets levels to the order in which they appear in the data, i.e. set the levels ‚Äúas is‚Äù | [forders.R](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-figalit/blob/master/foofactors/R/forders.R) | üëç |
| functions to write and read data frames to plain text delimited files while retaining factor levels; maybe by writing/reading a companion file | [write_df.R](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-figalit/blob/master/foofactors/R/write_df.R), [read_df.R](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw07-figalit/blob/master/foofactors/R/read_df.R) | üëç |

Enjoy!

## Resources I found useful


In order to navigate this repo, and mostly understand what I have done, [here](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html) is a super good primer on factors!

And [jenny's page](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block05_getNumbersOut.html#saverds-and-readrds)!
